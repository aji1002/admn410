<h3 style="text-align:center;"><u>About Us</u></h3>

<p>Durham House of Pets was founded in August 2016 in Durham, New Hampshire, by Andrew Iannuzzi. As a child, Andrew had always dreamed of opening his own business. While attending the University of New Hampshire in Durham, Andrew had noticed that there were plenty of pet owners, but there was nowhere in town to buy pet supplies. He set out to open Durham House of Pets, by intially selling homemade dog leashes around Durham. As soon as more people began to purchase his leashes, Andrew knew that he needed to expand his operations. He purchased a small storefront in downtown Durham, with a small loan, and his dream of owning his own business finally came to fruition. Now Durham House of Pets has become the focal point of pet expertise, in all of the communities surrounding Durham, New Hampshire.</p>
